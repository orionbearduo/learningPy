# INPUT()

## how the input() function works

The input() function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter some text. 
Once Python receives the user’s input, it assigns that input to a variable to make it convenient for you to work with.

e.g.
```py
message = input("Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: ")
print(message)
```

## f-Strings: A New and Improved Way to Format Strings in Python

```py
name = "Gao Mofan"
age = 10
print(f"Hello, {name}. You are {age}.")
```

## Multiline f-Strings

```py
name = "Eric"
profession = "comedian"
affiliation = "Monty Python"
message = (
    f"Hi {name}. "
    f"You are a {profession}. "
    f"You were in {affiliation}."
)
message
```

### 备注
1. '\n' to the next line
2. = 是赋值，== 是比较

## Using int() to Accept Numerical Input

When you use the input() function, Python interprets everything the user enters as a string. 
Consider the following interpreter session, which asks for the user’s age:

age = int(age)

### 练习
Write a program that asks the user how many people are in their dinner group. 
If the answer is more than eight, print a message saying they’ll have to wait for a table. 
Otherwise, report that their table is ready.

```python
party_size = input("How many people are in your dinner party tonight? ")
party_size = int(party_size)

if party_size > 8:
    print("I'm sorry, you'll have to wait for a table.")
else:
    print("Your table is ready.")
```
