```python
for i range(1,11):
    print(i)
```

```python
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
```

# Introducing while loops
在 python 里面有两种 loop:
1. for loop
2. while loop

### while loop:
The for loop takes a collection of items and executes a block of code once for each item in the collection. 
In contrast, the while loop runs as long as, or while, a certain condition is true.

The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.

### Syntax of while Loop in Python

```python
while test_expression:
    Body of while
```

In the while loop, test expression is checked first. 
The body of the loop is entered only if the test_expression evaluates to True.

Example:
```python
j = 4
while j == 3:
    print('ok')
    print('while loop is continuing.')
    break
print('j is not 3.')
```

After one iteration, the test expression is checked again. 
This process continues until the test_expression evaluates to False.

Example:
```python
j = 1
while j <= 10:
    print(f'i is {j}.')
    j = j + 1
print('Loop is over.')
```

In Python, the body of the while loop is determined through indentation(Space OR Tab).
Python interprets any non-zero value as True. None and 0 are interpreted as False.

Example:
```python
j = 0
while j == False:
    print('0 is False.')
    break
```

```
variable = variable + 1 -> variable += 1
variable = variable - 1 -> variable -= 1
variable = variable * 1 -> variable *= 1
variable = variable / 1 -> variable /= 1
```

Practise: count number 0 to 5
```python
current_number = 0
while current_number < 6:
    print(f'current number is {current_number}.')
    current_number += 1
```

Practise: 
```python
prompt = "\nTell me something, and I will repeat it back to you:"
prompt += "\nEnter 'quit' to end the program. "
message = ""
while message != 'quit':
    message = input(prompt)
    print(message)
print('Thank you for your cooperation.')
```
