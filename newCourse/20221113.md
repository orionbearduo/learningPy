#### Removing an Item by Value 

```py
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'kawasaki']
print(motorcycles)
motorcycles.remove('kawasaki')
print(motorcycles)
```

## Organizing a List

### Sorting a List Permanently with the sort() Method

```py
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
cars.sort()
print(cars)


cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
cars.sort(reverse=True)
print(cars)
```

### Sorting a List Temporarily with the sorted() Function

```py
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
print("Here is the original list:")
print(cars)
print("\nHere is the sorted list:")
print(sorted(cars))
print("\nHere is the original list again:")
print(cars)
```

### Printing a List in Reverse Order

```py
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
print(cars)
cars.reverse()
print(cars)
```

### Finding the Length of a List

```py
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
len(cars)
```

## Avoiding Index Errors When Working with Lists

```py
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles[3])
```
