## Working with Part of a List

### Slicing a List
```py
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print(players[0:3])
The code at u prints a slice of this list, which includes just the first
three players. The output retains the structure of the list and includes the
first three players in the list:
['charles', 'martina', 'michael']
You can generate any subset of a list. For example, if you want the second, third, and fourth items in a list, you would start the slice at index 1 and
end at index 4:
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print(players[1:4])
This time the slice starts with 'martina' and ends with 'florence':
['martina', 'michael', 'florence']
If you omit the first index in a slice, Python automatically starts your
slice at the beginning of the list:
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print(players[:4])
Without a starting index, Python starts at the beginning of the list:
['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence']
A similar syntax works if you want a slice that includes the end of a list.
For example, if you want all items from the third item through the last item,
you can start with index 2 and omit the second index:
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print(players[2:])
Python returns all items from the third item through the end of the list:
['michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print(players[-3:])
```

## Looping Through a Slice
```py
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print("Here are the first three players on my team:")
  for player in players[:3]:
print(player.title())
```

## Copying a List
To copy a list, you can make a slice that includes the entire original list
by omitting the first index and the second index ([:]).
```py
my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']
friend_foods = my_foods[:]
print("My favorite foods are:")
print(my_foods)
print("\nMy friend's favorite foods are:")
print(friend_foods)
```

# if statement
Programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take based on those conditions. Pythonâ€™s if statement allows you to examine the current state of a program and respond appropriately
to that state.

```py
cars = ['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']
for car in cars:
  if car == 'bmw':
    print(car.upper())
  else:
    print(car.title())
```

## Conditional Tests
### Checking for Equality
Most conditional tests compare the current value of a variable to a specific
value of interest. The simplest conditional test checks whether the value of a
variable is equal to the value of interest:
```py
car = 'bmw'
car == 'bmw'

car = 'audi'
car == 'bmw'
```

### Checking for Inequality
When you want to determine whether two values are not equal, you can combine an exclamation point and an equal sign (!=). The exclamation point represents not, as it does in many programming languages.
```py
requested_topping = 'mushrooms'
if requested_topping != 'anchovies':
  print("Hold the anchovies!")
```

### Numerical Comparisons
Testing numerical values is pretty straightforward. For example, the following code checks whether a person is 18 years old:
```py
age = 18
age == 18
```
You can include various mathematical comparisons in your conditional
statements as well, such as less than, less than or equal to, greater than, and
greater than or equal to:
```py
age = 19
age < 21

age <= 21

age > 21

age >= 21
```

### Checking Multiple Conditions
Using and to Check Multiple Conditions To check whether two conditions are both True simultaneously, use the keyword and to combine the two conditional tests; if each test passes, the overall expression evaluates to True. If either test fails or if both tests fail, the expression evaluates to False.

```py
age_0 = 22
age_1 = 18
age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21

age_1 = 22
age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21
```
To improve readability, you can use parentheses around the individual tests, but they are not required. If you use parentheses, your test would look like this:
```py
(age_0 >= 21) and (age_1 >= 21)
```

Using or to Check Multiple Conditions
The keyword or allows you to check multiple conditions as well, but it passes when either or both of the individual tests pass. An or expression fails only when both individual tests fail.
```py
age_0 = 22
age_1 = 18
age_0 >= 21 or age_1 >= 21

age_0 = 19
age_0 >= 21 or age_1 >= 21
```
