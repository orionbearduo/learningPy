## Exercise 1
Write a while loop that adds all the numbers from 0 to 100 (inclusive).
Expected Value: 5050 

Answer:
```python
counter = 0
total = 0

while counter <= 100:
    total += counter
    counter += 1
print(total)
```

## Exercise 2
Take 10 integers from keyboard using while loop and print their average value on the screen.

```python
total = 0
counter = 10

while counter > 0:
    print('Please enter an integer.')
    number = int(input())
    print(f'The number you entered was {number}.')
    total += number
    print(f'Total is {total}')
    counter -= 1
    if counter == 1:
        print(f'Remaining {counter} number to enter')
    elif counter == 0:
        print('Your input is finished.')
    else:
        print(f'Remaining {counter} numbers to enter')
avg = total/10.0
print(f'The average is {avg}')
```
